## About

Hi, my name is Owen Mowery. I am currently a Software Engineering student 
studying Ruby on Rails, Full Stack Javascript, and SQLite. 
I have 2+ years of experience in web development with HTML and CSS.
I'm interested in building out unique and intuitive web applications to 
solve real world problems with a focus on user experience. I plan to continue to grow my knowledge with a desire to learn new technologies in this field.
